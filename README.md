# Project Title

Our Project revolves around the "Smart Education" theme of Hack36. It aims at improving the quality of E-education over a local network, through one-to-many Video communication, i.e., techer-to-students live classes in a local college or university network. We are making it more analysis-oriented by using in it technologies like Facial Detection using Deep Learning, real-time Feedback using Charts and Alert systems, etc. We are also creating a summary at the end of the video lecture, both for the teacher's and the students' sides. At the end of the session, based on the data received by the ML Model, we can show the general attentiveness of all the students in the class to the teacher, highlighting the durations of the lecture where the students felt the most boredom or where most students had doubts, giving the lecturer an analysis on his/her performance and helping him in furtehr improving the course. On the Students' side, he/she would receive the feedback about his/her own concentration for the whole duration. Besides these features, the students and teachers, both would have a dashboard - where their past performance would be stored and also, they can add a to-do list for them to finsih for a particular day.        

## Getting Started

In these instructions, we will explain how to get a copy of the project up and running on any local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Here, we will inform what things anyone would need to install the software and how to install them.

```
And would also give examples.
```

### Installing

We will be providing a step by step series of examples that would tell how to get a development environment running.


## Running the tests

Here, we will explain how to run the tests for this system.


## Deployment

We will be adding additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
